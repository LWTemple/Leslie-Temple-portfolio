				<p>Skills: UI, UX, Competitve Analysis, Persona, User Flows, Wireframe, Prototype, Testing, Responsive Design, Style Guide, Moodboard, Mockup </p>
				<p>Challenge: The challenge in creating the Eat to Live web-based app was to keep the design clean, simple and organized - unlike many recipe apps out there. In my research, I found that users really want to find a recipe quickly and easily -
					without alot of clutter. Users also want to find healthy inspiring recipes that use ingredients in the pantry or fridge, along with recipes that will help them personally feel better. These features are included in the app, in a simple,
					clean design. </p>
				<p>Role: For this project, my role was to listen to my users and produce an app that does what the user needs. I was responsible for both the UX and UI, including user research, personas, user flows, wireframes, prototypes, usability testing,
					visual
					design and final high-fidelity mockups. </p>
				<p>Tools Used: Adobe XD, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Invision</p>

				<p>UI/UX Process </p>
				<p>Competitor Analysis & User Interviews/Research: I conducted a competitor analysis of similar recipe apps including Competitor Overview, Marketing Profile, SWOT Analysis, and UX Analysis. A questionaire was compiled and 3 users were
					interviewed in depth to determine what they are looking for in a recipe app, what is important and not important, their process for finding recipes, finding inspiration, searching methods, and important features. This research was compiled
					& organized for content use.

				<p>User Personas:With info from user interviews, I created user 3 personas - including the following demographics - goals, frustrations, motivations, technology, personality and favorite brands. </p>

				<p>User Flow Diagrams: Using principles of Lean UX to craft a better user experience - I created user flow diagrams for each entry point which shows the architecture of the site. User flows were kept simple and direct, making this an easy to follow experience for
					the user. </p>

				<p>Low-Fidelity Sketches and Usability Test: Using a mobile first approach, quick sketches were created based on the user flow diagram, showing basic layout of the app screens. An interactive prototype was created using Invision, allowing for user testing and gaining feedback -
					without spending alot of time. I conducted a moderated user test using paper prototypes, iterated and made edits based on feedback - to improve the usability of the app </p>

				<p>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes: Next, based on the paper prototype and feedback from users, mid-fi wireframes were created for each screen. This began the UI phase of the project. The previous UX work came into play in creating these wireframes.</p>

				<p>Style Guide & Moodboard: Inspiration was gathered and curated - building a moodboard to communicate the artistic direction quickly and effectively. Imagery, colors, fonts, quotes, and other component curated resources were included based on target audience. For the
					final UI design, a style guide was created - including typography, color palette, key UI elements and styles, imagery, and icons. This style guide was then applied to all high-fidelity wireframes. </p>

				<p>High-Fidelity Wireframes: Final high-fidelity pixel perfect wireframes for all 4 breakpoints were created using the mobile first approach, including iterations made to my designs from peer feedback. </p>
